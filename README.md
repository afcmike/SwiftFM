# SwiftFM

Swift wrapper for the FileMaker Data API (Swift 5+, iOS 15+)

SwiftFM was refactored (rewritten from scratch) last week, put under version control, and now provides support for Swift Package Manager (SPM).

Notable improvements include type-safe Codable returns and support for async/await. Several APIs were added, including support for executing scripts, setting containers, as well as getting metadata on hosts, databases, layouts, and scripts.

Documentation (extensive) forthcoming.

Thanks for your support of this project over the past 3.5 years. ðŸ˜˜
