# SwiftFM

Swift framework for the FileMaker Data API (Swift 5+, iOS 15+)

SwiftFM was ~~refactored~~ rewritten from scratch last week, put under version control, and now provides support for Swift Package Manager (SPM). ðŸŽ‰

Notable improvements include async/await and type-safe Codable returns. Several new APIs were added, including support for executing scripts, setting containers, as well as getting metadata on hosts, databases, layouts, and scripts.

Documentation (extensive) forthcoming, with SwiftUI examples.

Thanks for supporting this project over the past 3 years. It means a lot. ðŸ˜˜
