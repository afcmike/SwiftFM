# SwiftFM

A modern Swift wrapper for the FileMaker Data API

SwiftFM was refactored (rewritten from scratch) last week, put under version control, and now provides support for Swift Package Manager (SPM).

Notable improvements include type-safe Codable return types and support for async/await URLSession calls. Several new APIs were added as well, including FileMaker container support, host info, database info, layouts, layout metadata, etc...

Documentation forthcoming.

Thanks for your support of this project over the past 3.5 years. ðŸ˜˜
